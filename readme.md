# YT Sub Grabber (Alpha)
Export a CSV of all your YouTube subscriptions for use in [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) and [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/)

> ⚠️  This extension is in Alpha, please expect jank, bugs and janky bugs.

## Why & What?
I got sick of having to use google takeout every time I wanted to update my subscriptions
in FreeTube and Newpipe. This extension adds a super simple button to your manage subscriptions
page that will save them as a CSV.

## Disclaimer
Use this extension at your own risk. The CSV is generated using undocumented data on the youtube
webpage. It could change or become unavailable at any time. There are other ways to generate this
data, however, so hopefully we can stay on top of it.
